# Nextcord

Nextcord is a WIP fork of Vencord that aims to be easier to modify and extend.

## How does it work?

So the idea is that you create a action in your repo, that will run a script that will build Nextcord with the changes you want.

Then the action will create a release and branch for your version of Nextcord.
